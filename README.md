# SynonymFinder

## Description

A project that allows users to search for synonyms using the Merriam-Webster Thesaurus.

## Learning Goals

The major goal of this project was to build a project in the Vue.js framework. Since I usually use React this project demonstrates that I can create a project using a different framework in a short time (1 week).
